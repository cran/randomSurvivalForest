\title{Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) Data}
\description{
  Data from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of
  the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984.  A total of 424 PBC
  patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during that ten-year interval, met
  eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo controlled trial of
  the drug D-penicillamine.  The first 312 cases in the data set
  participated in the randomized trial and contain largely complete
  data.  The additional 112 cases did not participate in the clinical
  trial, but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be
  followed for survival.  Six of those cases were lost to follow-up
  shortly after diagnosis, so the data here are on an additional 106
  cases as well as the 312 randomized participants.  Missing data items
  are denoted by NA.
